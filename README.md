# CardStackAnimation

### Description
A simple implementation to mimic card stacks in Android. This project demonstrates how to create a smooth card stack animation with basic translation and scaling effects using Android's built-in animation framework.

---

### Features
- Uses **ValueAnimator** and **ObjectAnimator** to handle view **translation** and **scaling** animations.
- Stacks views on a **FrameLayout** for easy layering and movement.

### Logical Structure
1. **Translation and Scaling**: Animations are created using Android's Value and Object Animators to smoothly translate and scale views when interacted with.
2. **FrameLayout** Stacking: The implementation is designed to work with a FrameLayout, making the view stack seamless and efficient.
